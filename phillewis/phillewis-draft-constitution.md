# CARDANO BLOCKCHAIN CONSTITUTION
## PREAMBLE
This Constitution serves to define the minimum necessary tenets and guardrails required to provide a balance between protecting the integrity of the Cardano blockchain, and the freedoms of the Cardano community wishing to contribute to or utilise the Cardano blockchain.

## ARTICLE I. CARDANO BLOCKCHAIN TENETS AND GUARDRAILS
### Section 1

These below Tenets shall guide all participants of the Cardano community, including the Constitutional Committee, and proposed governance actions shall be evaluated in accordance with these Tenets. The order in which the below Tenets appear is not intended to represent a priority among Tenets.

**TENET 1** Transactions on the Cardano blockchain shall not be slowed down or censored and shall be expediently served for their intended purpose.

**TENET 2** The cost of transactions on the Cardano blockchain shall be predictable and not unreasonable.

**TENET 3** Anyone desiring to develop and deploy applications on the Cardano blockchain shall not unreasonably be prevented from developing and deploying such applications as intended.

**TENET 4** The Cardano blockchain shall not lock in an ada owner's value without an owner's consent.

**TENET 6** The Cardano blockchain shall preserve in a safe manner any value and information an ada owner seeks to store on the Cardano blockchain.

**TENET 7** All users of the Cardano blockchain shall be treated equally, taking into account the collective desires of the Cardano blockchain community, consistent with the long-term sustainability and viability of the Cardano blockchain.

**TENET 8** Financial stability shall be maintained and the total supply of ada shall not exceed 45,000,000,000 (45,000,000,000,000,000 lovelace).

### Section 2

The Cardano blockchain shall operate in accordance with the Cardano Blockchain Guardrails Appendix. The Cardano community may from time to time digitally codify certain Cardano blockchain guardrails, such that they are directly programmed and implemented on the Cardano blockchain using on-chain scripts or built-in ledger rules.

In the event there are inconsistencies between a Cardano blockchain guardrail as set forth in the Cardano Blockchain Guardrails Appendix and any such Cardano blockchain guardrail that has been programmed and implemented on the Cardano blockchain, the version of such Cardano blockchain guardrail that has been deployed directly on the Cardano blockchain shall prevail and the Constitutional Committee shall seek to reconcile such inconsistencies through the encouragement of an appropriate on-chain governance action.

## ARTICLE II. THE CARDANO BLOCKCHAIN COMMUNITY
### Section 1
The Cardano blockchain is permissionless infrastructure that may be used by **anyone** in accordance with how it is intended to operate at any given moment, noting that its function may change over time following governance actions to enact changes in accordance with the governance process described in this Constitution.

## ARTICLE III. PARTICIPATORY AND DECENTRALIZED GOVERNANCE
### Section 1
The Cardano blockchain shall be governed by a decentralised, on-chain governance model, as implemented in the Cardano blockchain software systems at the time of use.
### Section 2
Three independent governance bodies shall participate in voting for on-chain governance actions, providing the checks and balances necessary to ensure the integrity of the Cardano blockchain, consisting of Delegated Representatives (DReps), Stake Pool Operators (SPOs), and the Constitutional Committee (CC).
### Section 3
On-chain governance decisions shall be made through a collective decision-making process, with specific consensus threshold requirements as specified in the Cardano Blockchain Guardrails Appendix.
### Section 4
The description of proposed governance actions are expected to follow a standardized and legible format including a URL and hash linked to documented off-chain content. Sufficient rationale shall be provided to justify the requested change to the Cardano blockchain.
### Section 5
“Hard Fork Initiation” and “Protocol Parameter Change” governance actions shall undergo sufficient technical review and scrutiny as mandated in the Cardano Blockchain Guardrails Appendix, to ensure that the governance action does not endanger the security, functionality, performance, or long-term sustainability of the Cardano blockchain. On-chain governance actions should address their expected impact on the Cardano blockchain ecosystem.
### Section 6
"Treasury Withdrawal" governance actions must request either a partial or full amount of a previously approved "Info" governance action that specifies a budget for the ongoing maintenance and future development of the Cardano blockchain. "Info" governance actions relating to a Cardano budget must be approved not less than on an annual basis.

## ARTICLE IV. DELEGATED REPRESENTATIVES
### Section 1
In order to participate in governance actions, owners of ada may register as DReps and directly vote on such governance actions or may delegate their voting rights to other registered DReps who shall vote on their behalf.

## ARTICLE V. STAKE POOL OPERATORS
### Section 1
Stake Pool Operators (SPOs) shall have a specific role in approving critical on-chain governance actions which require additional oversight and independence, voting separately and independently from DReps as set forth in the Cardano Blockchain Guardrails Appendix. SPOs shall participate in hard fork initiation processes as the operators of the nodes that participate in Cardano blockchain’s consensus mechanism.
### Section 2
SPOs shall act as a check on the power of the Constitutional Committee under exceptional circumstances by separately voting on "Motion of no-confidence" and "Update committee/threshold" governance actions, and on “Parameter Update” governance actions that affect security-critical parameters.

## ARTICLE VI. CONSTITUTIONAL COMMITTEE
### Section 1
A Constitutional Committee shall be established in accordance with the Cardano Blockchain Guardrails Appendix, as a set of owners of ada, who are collectively responsible for ensuring that prior to enactment on-chain, governance actions are constitutional.

### Section 2
No governance action, other than a "Motion of no-confidence," or "Update constitutional committee/threshold" may be implemented on-chain unless a requisite percentage as specified by the guardrails of the members of the Constitutional Committee shall have first determined and affirmed through an on-chain action that such proposal does not violate this Constitution.

### Section 3
The Constitutional Committee shall be considered to be in one of the following two states at all times: a state of confidence or a state of no-confidence. In a state of no-confidence, members of the then standing Constitutional Committee must be reinstated or replaced using the "Update committee/threshold" governance action before any other on-chain governance action, other than “Info” actions, may go forward.

If deemed necessary, an individual member of the Constitutional Committee may be removed following the enactment of an on-chain governance action in accordance with the Cardano Blockchain Guardrails Appendix.

### Section 4
Constitutional Committee processes shall be transparent. The Constitutional Committee shall publish each decision, either collectively or as individual voting members, with a rationale and references to specific Articles of this Constitution or provisions of the Guardrails Appendix used to justify the decision.

## ARTICLE VII. AMENDMENTS
### Section 1
Except as otherwise so provided in the Cardano Blockchain Guardrails Appendix, amendments to this Constitution, including to the Cardano Blockchain Guardrails Appendix, shall be approved by a collective decision-making process, requiring an on-chain governance action by owners of ada satisfying a threshold of not less than 67% of the then active voting stake.

### Section 2
If the Cardano Blockchain Guardrails Appendix sets forth an amendment threshold for a Cardano blockchain guardrail that is different than the amendment threshold contained in Section 1 of this Article VII, then the threshold set forth in the Cardano Blockchain Guardrails Appendix for such Cardano blockchain guardrail shall apply.

## APPENDIX I: CARDANO BLOCKCHAIN GUARDRAILS
### 1. INTRODUCTION

To implement Cardano blockchain on-chain governance, it is necessary to establish sensible guardrails that will enable the Cardano blockchain to continue to operate in a secure and sustainable way.

This Appendix sets forth guardrails that must be applied to Cardano blockchain on-chain governance actions, including changes to the protocol parameters and limits on treasury withdrawals. These guardrails cover both essential, intrinsic limits on settings, and recommendations that are based on experience, measurement and governance objectives.

These guardrails are designed to avoid unexpected problems with the operation of the Cardano blockchain. They are intended to guide the choice of sensible parameter settings and avoid potential problems with security, performance, functionality or long-term sustainability. As described below, some of these guardrails are automatable and will be enforced via an on-chain script or built-in ledger rules.

These guardrails apply only to the Cardano blockchain Layer 1 mainnet environment. They are not intended to apply to test environments or to other blockchains that use the Cardano blockchain software.

Not all parameters for the Cardano blockchain can be considered independently. Some parameters interact with other settings in an intrinsic way. Where known, these interactions are addressed in this Appendix.

While the guardrails in this Appendix presently reflect the current state of technical insight, this Appendix should be treated as a living document. Implementation improvements, new simulations or performance evaluation results for the Cardano blockchain may allow some of the restrictions contained in these guardrails to be relaxed (or, in some circumstances, require them to be tightened) in due course.

Additional guardrails may also be needed where, for example, new protocol parameters are introduced.

#### Amending, Adding or Deprecating Guardrails
The guardrails set forth in this Appendix may be amended from time to time pursuant to an on chain governance action that satisfies the applicable voting threshold as set forth in this Appendix. Any such amendment to any guardrails shall require and be deemed to be an amendment to the Constitution itself, including any new guardrails. Each guardrail has a unique label. If the text of a guardrail is amended, the existing guardrail will be deprecated and a new label will be used in this Appendix. Similarly, if a guardrail is completely deprecated, its label will never be reused in the future. In all cases, the guardrails that apply to a governance action will be those in force at the time that the governance action is submitted on chain, regardless of any later amendments.

#### Terminology and Guidance

**Should/Should not.** Where this Appendix says that a value "should not" be set below or above some value, this means that the guardrail is a recommendation or guideline, and the specific value could be open to discussion or alteration by a suitably expert group recognized by the Cardano community in light of experience with the Cardano blockchain governance system or the operation of the Cardano blockchain.

**Must/Must not.** Where this Appendix says that a value “must” or "must not" be set below or above some value, this means that the guardrail is a requirement that will be enforced by Cardano blockchain ledger rules, types or other built-in mechanisms where possible, and that if not followed could cause a protocol failure,security breach or other undesirable outcome.

**Benchmarking.** Benchmarking refers to careful system level performance evaluation that is designed to show a-priori that, for example, 95% of blocks will be diffused across a global network of Cardano blockchain nodes within the required 5s time interval in all cases. This may require construction of specific test workflows and execution on a large test network of Cardano blockchain nodes, simulating a global Cardano blockchain network.

**Performance analysis.** Performance analysis refers to projecting theoretical performance,empirical benchmarking or simulation results to predict actual system behavior. For example,performance results obtained from tests in a controlled test environment (such as a collection of data centers with known networking properies) may be extrapolated to inform likely performance behavior in a real Cardano blockchain network environment.

**Simulation.** Simulation refers to synthetic execution that is designed to inform performance/functionality decisions in a repeatable way. For example, the IOSim Cardano blockchain module allows the operation of the networking stack to be simulated in a controlled and repeatable way, allowing issues to be detected before code deployment.

**Performance Monitoring.** Performance monitoring involves measuring the actual behavior of the Cardano blockchain network, for example, by using timing probes to evaluate round-trip times, or test blocks to assess overall network health. It complements benchmarking and performance analysis by providing information about actual system behavior that cannot be obtained using simulated workloads or theoretical analysis.

**Reverting Changes.** Where performance monitoring shows that actual network behavior following a change is inconsistent with the performance requirements for the Cardano blockchain, then the change must be reverted to its previous state if that is possible.For example,if the block size is increased from 100KB to 120KB and 95% of blocks areno longer diffused within 5s, then a change must be made to revert the block size to 100KB. If this is not possible, then one or more alternative changes must be made that will ensure that the performance requirements are met.

**Severity Levels.** Issues that affect the Cardano blockchain network are classified by severity level, where:

* Severity 1 is a critical incident or issue with very high impact to the security,performance, functionality or long-term sustainability of the Cardano blockchain network
* Severity 2 is a major incident or issue with significant impact to the security,performance, functionality or long-term sustainability of the Cardano blockchain network  
* Severity 3 is a minor incident or issue with low impact to the security,performance,functionality or long-term sustainability of the Cardano blockchain network

**Future Performance Requirements.** Planned development such as new mechanisms for out of memory storage may impact block diffusion or other times. When changing parameters, it is necessary to consider these future performance requirements as well as the current operation of the Cardano blockchain. Until development is complete, the requirements will be conservative but may then be relaxed to account for actual timing behavior.

#### Automated Checking ("Guardrails Script")

A script hash is associated with the constitution hash when a **New Constitution or Guardrails Script** governance action is enacted. It acts as an additional safeguard to the ledger rules and types,filtering non-compliant governance actions.

The guardrails script only affects two types of governance actions:

* **Parameter Update** actions, and  
* **Treasury Withdrawal** actions.

The script is executed when either of these types of governance action is submitted on-chain.This avoids scenarios where, for example, an erroneous script could prevent the chain from ever enacting a Hard Fork action, resulting in deadlock. There are three different situations that apply to script usage.

#### Symbol and Explanation

* (y) The script can be used to enforce the guardrail.  
* (x) The script cannot be used to enforce the guardrail.  
* (~-reason) The script cannot be used to enforce the guardrail for the reason given,but future ledger changes could enable this.

Guardrails may overlap: in this case, the most restrictive set of guardrails will apply.

Where a parameter is not explicitly listed in this document, then the script **must not** permits any changes to the parameter.

Conversely,where a parameter is explicitly listed in this document but no checkable guardrails are specified, the script **must not** imposes any constraints on changes to the parameter.

### 2. GUARDRAILS AND GUIDELINES ON PROTOCOL PARAMETER UPDATE ACTIONS

Below are guardrails and guidelines for changing updatable protocol parameter settings via the protocol parameter update governance action such that the Cardano blockchain is never in an unrecoverable state as a result of such changes.

Note that, to avoid ambiguity, this Appendix uses the parameter name that is used in protocol parameter update governance actions rather than any other convention.

#### Guardrails

PARAM-01 (y) Any protocol parameter that is not explicitly named in this document **must not** be changed by a Parameter update governance action

PARAM-02 (y) Where a protocol parameter is explicitly listed in this document but no checkable guardrails are specified, the guardrails script **must not** impose any constraints on changes to the parameter. Checkable guardrails are shown by a (y)

#### 2.1. Critical Protocol Parameters

The below protocol parameters are critical from a security point of view.

##### Parameters that are Critical to the Operation of the Blockchain

* *maximum block body size*(*maxBlockBodySize*)  
* *maximum transaction size* (*maxTxSize*)  
* *maximum block header size* (*maxBlockHeaderSize*)  
* *maximum size of a serialized asset value* (*maxValueSize*)
* *maximum script execution/memory units in a single block* (*maxBlockExecutionUnits[steps/memory]*)
* *minimum fee coefficient*(*txFeePerByte*)

* *minimum Lovelace deposit per byte of serialized UTxO* (*utxoCostPerByte*)
* *governance action deposit* (*govDeposit*)

##### Guardrails

PARAM-03 (y) Critical protocol parameters require an SPO vote in addition to a DRep vote: SPOs **must** say "yes" with a collective support of more than 50% of all active block production stake. This is enforced by the guardrails on the stake pool voting threshold.

PARAM-04 (x) At least 3 months **should** normally pass between the publication of an off-chain proposal to change a critical protocol parameter and the submission of the corresponding on-chain governance action. This guardrail may be relaxed in the event of a Severity 1 or Severity 2 network issue following careful technical discussion and evaluation.

##### Parameters that are Critical to the Governance System

* *delegation key Lovelace deposit* (*stakeAddressDeposit*)
* *pool registration Lovelace deposit* (*stakePoolDeposit*)
* *minimum fixed rewards cut for pools* (*minPoolCost*)
* *DRep deposit amount* (*dRepDeposit*)
* *minimal Constitutional Committee size* (*committeeMinSize*)
* *maximum term length (in epochs) for the Constitutional Committee members* (*committeeMaxTermLimit*)

##### Guardrails

PARAM-05 (y) DReps **must** vote "yes" with a collective support of more than 50% of all active voting stake. This is enforced by the guardrails on the DRep voting thresholds.

PARAM-06 (x) At least 3 months **should** normally pass between the publication of an off-chain proposal to change a parameter that is critical to the governance system and the submission of the corresponding on-chain governance action. This guardrail may be relaxed in the event of a Severity 1 or Severity 2 network issue following careful technical discussion and evaluation.

#### 2.2. Economic Parameters

The overall goals when managing economic parameters are to:

* Enable long-term economic sustainability for the Cardano blockchain ecosystem;  
* Ensure that stake pools are adequately rewarded for maintaining the Cardano blockchain;  
* Ensure that ada holders are adequately rewarded for using stake in constructive ways,including when delegating ada for block production; and  
* Balance economic incentives for different Cardano blockchain ecosystem stakeholders, including but not limited to Stake Pool Operators, ada holders, DeFi users,infrastructure users, developers (e.g. DApps) and financial intermediaries (e.g.exchanges)

##### Triggers for Change

* Significant changes in the fiat value of ada resulting in potential problems with security, performance, functionality or long-term sustainability  
* Changes in transaction volumes or types  
* Community requests or suggestions  
* Emergency situations that require changes to economic parameters

##### Counter-indicators

Changes to the economic parameters should not be made in isolation. They need to account for:

* External economic factors
* Network security concerns

##### Core Metrics

* Fiat value of ada resulting in potential problems with security,performance, functionality or long-term sustainability  
* Transaction volumes and types  
* Number and health of stake pools  
* External economic factors

##### Changes to Specific Economic Parameters

Transaction fee per byte (txFeePerByte) and fixed transaction fee (txFeeFixed)

Defines the cost for basic transactions in Lovelace:

*fee(tx) =txFeeFixed+ txFeePerByte x nBytes(tx)*

##### Guardrails

TFPB-01 (y) *txFeePerByte* **must not** be lower than 30 (0.000030 ada)

This protects against low-cost denial of service attacks

TFPB-02 (y) *txFeePerByte* **must not** exceed 1,000 (0.001 ada)

This ensures that transactions can be paid for

TFPB-03 (y) *txFeePerByte* **must not** be negative

TFF-01 (y) *txFeeFixed* **must not** be lower than 100,000 (0.1 ada)

This protects against low-cost denial of service attacks

TFF-02 (y) *txFeeFixed* **must not** exceed 10,000,000(10 ada)

This ensures that transactions can be paid for

TFF-03 (y) *txFeeFixed* **must not** be negative.

TFGEN-01 (x - "should") To maintain a consistent level of protection against denial-of-service attacks, *txFeeFixed* and *txFeePerByte* **should** be adjusted whenever Plutus Execution prices are adjusted (executionUnitPrices[steps/memory]).

TFGEN-02 (x - unquantifiable) Any changes to *txFeeFixed* or *txFeePerByte* **must** consider the implications of reducing the cost of a denial-of-service attack or increasing the maximum transaction fee so that it becomes impossible to construct a transaction.

##### UTxO cost per byte (utxoCostPerByte)

Defines the deposit (in Lovelace) that is charged for each byte of storage that is held in a UTxO.This deposit is returned when the UTxO is no longer active.

* Sets a minimum threshold on ada that is held within a single UTxO  
* Provides protection against low-cost denial of service attack on UTxO storage.
* DoS protection decreases in line with the free node memory (proportional to UTxO growth)
* Helps reduce long term storage costs for node users by providing an incentive to return UTxOs when no longer needed, or to merge UTxOs.

##### Guardrails

UCPB-01 (y) *utxoCostPerByte* **must not** be lower than 3,000 (0.003 ada)

UCPB-02 (y) *utxoCostPerByte* **must not** exceed 6,500 (0.0065 ada)

UCPB-03 (y) *utxoCostPerByte* **must not** be zero

UCPB-04 (y) *utxoCostPerByte* **must not** be negative

UCPB-05a (x -"should") Changes **should** account for

i) The acceptable cost of attack

ii) The acceptable time for an attack

iii) The acceptable memory configuration for full node users

iv) The sizes of UTxOs and

v) The current total node memory usage

##### Stake address deposit (stakeAddressDeposit)

Ensures that stake addresses are retired when no longer needed

* Helps reduce long term storage costs  
* Helps limit CPU and memory costs in the ledger

The rationale for the deposit is to incentivize that scarce memory resources are returned when they are no longer required. Reducing the number of active stake addresses also reduces processing and memory costs at the epoch boundary when calculating stake snapshots.

##### Guardrails

SAD-01 (y) *stakeAddressDeposit* **must not** be lower than 1,000,000 (1 ada)

SAD-02 (y) *stakeAddressDeposit* **must not** exceed 5,000,000 (5ada)

SAD-03 (y) *stakeAddressDeposit* **must not** be negative

#### Stake pool deposit (stakePoolDeposit)

Ensures that stake pools are retired by the stake pool operator when no longer needed by them

* Helps reduce long term storage costs

The rationale for the deposit is to incentivize that scarce memory resources are returned when they are no longer required. Rewards and stake snapshot calculations are also impacted by the number of active stake pools.

##### Guardrails

SPD-01 (y) *stakePoolDeposit* **must not** be lower than 250,000,000 (250 ada)

SPD-02 (y) *stakePoolDeposit* **must not** exceed 500,000,000 (500 ada)

SPD-03 (y) *stakePoolDeposit* **must not** be negative

#### Minimum Pool Cost (minPoolCost)

Part of the rewards mechanism

* The minimum pool cost is transferred to the pool rewards address before any delegator rewards are paid

##### Guardrails

MPC-01 (y) *minPoolCost* **must not** be negative

MPC-02 (y) *minPoolCost* **must not** exceed 500,000,000 (500 ada)

MPC-03 (x -"should") *minPoolCost* **should** be set in line with the economic cost for operating a pool

#### Treasury Cut (treasuryCut)

Part of the rewards mechanism

The treasury cut portion of the monetary expansion is transferred to the treasury before any pool rewards are paid

* Can be set in the range 0.0-1.0 (0%-100%)

##### Guardrails

TC-01 (y) *treasuryCut* **must not** be lower than 0.1(10%)

TC-02 (y) *treasuryCut* **must not** exceed 0.3(30%)

TC-03 (y) *treasuryCut* **must not** be negative

TC-04 (y) *treasuryCut* **must not** exceed 1.0(100%)

TC-05 (~-no access to change history) *treasuryCut* **must not** be changed more than once in any 36 epoch period (approximately 6 months)

#### Monetary Expansion Rate (monetaryExpansion)

Part of the rewards mechanism

* The monetary expansion controls the amount of reserves that is used for rewards each epoch
* Governs the long-term sustainability of Cardano
* The reserves are gradually depleted until no rewards are supplied

##### Guardrails

ME-01 (y) *monetaryExpansion***must not** exceed 0.005

ME-02 (y) *monetaryExpansion* **must not** be lower than 0.001

ME-03 (y) *monetaryExpansion** must not'**be negative

ME-04 (x - "should") *monetaryExpansion* **should not** be varied by more than +/- 10% in any 73-epoch period (approximately 12 months)

ME-05 (x- "should") *monetaryExpansion* **should not** be changed more than once in any 36-epoch period (approximately 6 months)

#### Plutus Script Execution Prices (executionUnitPrices[priceSteps/priceMemory])

Define the fees for executing Plutus scripts

Gives an economic return for Plutus script execution

Provides security against low-cost DoS attacks

##### Guardrails

EIUP-PS-01 (y) *executionUnitPrices[priceSteps]* **must not** exceed 2,000/10,000,000

EIUP-PS-02 (y) *executionUnitPrices[priceSteps]* **must not** be lower than 500/10,000,000

EIUP-PM-01 (y) *executionUnitPrices[priceMemory]* **must not** exceed 2,000/10,000

EIUP-PM-02 (y) *executionUnitPrices[priceMemory]* **must not** be lower than 400 / 10,000.

EIUP-GEN-01 (x - "similar to") The execution prices **must** be set so that:

i) the cost of executing a transaction with maximum CPU steps is similar to the cost of a maximum sized non-script transaction and

ii) the cost of executing a transaction with maximum memory units is similar to the cost of a maximum sized non-script transaction

EIUP-GEN-02 (x - "should") The execution prices **should** be adjusted whenever transaction fees are adjusted (*txFeeFixed/txFeePerByte*). The goal is to ensure that the processing delay is similar for "full" transactions, regardless of their type.

* This helps ensure that the requirements on block diffusion/propagation times are met.

#### Transaction fee per byte for a reference script (minFeeRefScriptCoinsPerByte)

Defines the cost for using Plutus reference scripts in Lovelace

##### Guardrails

MFRS-01 (y) *minFeeRefScriptCoinsPerByte* **must not** exceed 1,000 (0.001 ada).

* This ensures that transactions can be paid for

MFRS-02 (y) *minFeeRefScriptCoinsPerByte* **must not** be negative

MFRS-03 (x - "should") To maintain a consistent level of protection against denial-of-service attacks, *minFeeRefScriptCoinsPerByte* **should** be adjusted whenever Plutus Execution prices are adjusted (*executionUnitPrices[steps/memory]*) and whenever *txFeeFixed* is adjusted

MFRS-04 (x - unquantifiable) Any changes to *minFeeRefScriptCoinsPerByte'* **must** consider the implications of reducing the cost of a denial-of-service attack or increasing the maximum transaction fee

#### 2.3. Network Parameters

The overall goals when managing the Cardano blockchain network parameters are to:

1. Match the available Cardano blockchain Layer 1 network capacity to current or future traffic demands, including payment transactions, layer 1 DApps, sidechain management and governance needs
2. Balance traffic demands for different user groups, including payment transactions,minters of Fungible/Non-Fungible Tokens, Plutus scripts, DeFi developers, Stake Pool Operators and voting transactions

##### Triggers for Change

Changes to network parameters may be triggered by:

* Measured changes in traffic demands over a 2-epoch period (10 days)  
* Anticipated changes in traffic demands  
* Community requests

##### Counter-indicators

Changes may need to be reversed and/or should not be enacted in the event of:

* Excessive block propagation delays
* Stake pools being unable to handle traffic volume  
* Scripts being unable to complete execution

##### Core Metrics

All decisions on parameter changes should be informed by:

* Block propagation delay profile  
* Traffic volume (block size over time)  
* Script volume (size of scripts and execution units)  
* Script execution cost benchmarks  
* Block propagation delay/diffusion benchmarks

Detailed benchmarking results are required to confirm the effect of any changes on mainnet performance or behavior prior to enactment. The effects of different transaction mixes must be analyzed, including normal transactions, Plutus scripts, and governance actions.

##### Guardrails

NETWORK-01 (x - "should") No individual network parameter **should** change more than once per two epochs

NETWORK-02 (x - "should") Only one network parameter **should** be changed per epoch unless they are directly correlated, e.g., per-transaction and per-block memory unit limits

MBBS-05 (x- "should") *maxBlockBodySize* **should** be changed by at most 10,240 Bytes (10KB) per epoch (5 days), and preferably by 8,192 Bytes (8KB) or less per epoch

MBBS-06 (x - "should") The block size **should not** induce an additional Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) round trip. Any increase beyond this must be backed by performance analysis, simulation, and benchmarking.

MBBS-07 (x - "unquantifiable") The impact of any change to *maxBlockBodySize* **must** be confirmed by detailed benchmarking/simulation and not exceed the requirements of the block diffusion/propagation time budgets, as described below. Any increase to *maxBlockBodySize* must also consider future requirements for Plutus script execution (*maxBlockExecutionUnits[steps]*) against the total block diffusion target of 3s with 95% block propagation within 5s. The limit on maximum block size may be increased in the future if this is supported by benchmarking and monitoring results.
